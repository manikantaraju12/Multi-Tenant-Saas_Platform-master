# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

A **production-ready, scalable multi-tenant SaaS application** designed for managing projects and tasks with **strict tenant isolation**, **secure authentication**, and **role-based access control**.  
The system is fully containerized and can be launched using a **single Docker Compose command**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Complete tenant data isolation  
- JWT-based secure authentication  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three roles:
  - `super_admin`
  - `tenant_admin`
  - `user`
- End-to-end project and task management  
- Automated database migrations and seed data execution  
- Containerized backend, frontend, and database services  
- Dedicated backend health-check endpoint  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- PostgreSQL  
- JWT Authentication  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  

### Frontend
- React (Vite)  
- Axios for API communication  
- Role-based UI rendering  

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Docker  
- Docker Compose  

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Start the Application
From the project root directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d

### 🔍 Verify Backend Health

After starting the services, verify that the backend is running correctly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

### 🌐 Access the Application

- **Web UI:** http://localhost:3000

> ⚠️ **No manual database setup is required.**  
> Database schema creation and seed data are handled automatically on application startup.


### 🌐 Service Endpoints

| Service       | URL                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend     | http://localhost:3000            |
| Backend API  | http://localhost:5000            |
| Health Check | http://localhost:5000/api/health |

### 🔐 Preloaded Evaluation Credentials

### Tenant Administrator

- **Email:** `admin@acme.com`  
- **Password:** `Admin@123`  
- **Tenant ID:** `acme`  

> These credentials are also documented in `submission.json`.

### 🔑 Login Instructions

1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/login**
2. Enter the provided credentials
3. Submit the login form
4. You will be redirected to the main dashboard

With this account, you can:
- Manage users and roles
- Create and maintain projects
- Assign and track tasks
- Perform tenant-level administrative actions

### 🔒 Authentication & Authorization Model

| Role          | Permissions                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| super_admin  | Full system-wide control                   |
| tenant_admin | Administrative control within a tenant     |
| user         | Standard tenant-level access               |

Each tenant operates in **complete isolation** from all other tenants.

### 🐳 Dockerized Services & Ports

| Service   | Description               | Port Mapping |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| database | PostgreSQL database       | 5432 → 5432  |
| backend  | Express API server        | 5000 → 5000  |
| frontend | React web application    | 3000 → 3000  |
